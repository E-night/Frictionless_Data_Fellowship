# My-Frictionless-Data-Fellowhip
I aim to learn and use the FD tools to improve the quality of data within my own projects, to teach and train students and researchers on adopting FD tools for more reproducible research and lastly, to develop and disseminate an FD tool that will harmonize agricultural research data in Africa to strengthen research capacity in the continent and beyond
